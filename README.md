# CPSC-4810-project
Nowadays the housing pric increased compared to the past. This is a serious problems for tenants and also for the landlords. We considered many reason for the increasing price. For example, the inflation, popularity of Vancouver housing, and the immigrants moving to Canada. For this project we will be focusing on the immigrants to Canada. The topic for our project is "How long did it take for immigrants to Canada affect the housing price in Lower Mainland".
The data source is made available by Census Canada website and statistic Canada.
